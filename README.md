# My Blazor WebAssembly Portfolio & App Hub

A **personal site** built with **Blazor WebAssembly**, serving as both my **developer portfolio** and a **launchpad for WebAssembly apps** I build over time.

## Overview

This project is a **modular Blazor WebAssembly application** designed to:
- Showcase my **personal projects**.
- Host and run **interactive WebAssembly apps** directly in the browser.
- Serve as a **living sandbox** for experimenting with .NET, WebAssembly, and modern web architecture.

Itâ€™s fast, fully client-side, and built to evolve as I publish new apps.
